# Celeb Photo Prompt Maker

A lightweight static web app that builds an edit-image prompt from simple form inputs. The final prompt matches the provided template so you can copy it directly into your local image-generating platform.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser (or serve the folder with any static server). Fill out the fields for action, celebrity details, movie scene, and the desired result description, then click **Generate prompt**. Use **Copy prompt** to place the JSON on your clipboard.

This project is ready for GitHub Pages—just push the repository and enable Pages for the `work` branch or your chosen publish branch.
